# UPI India (for Android only)

This plugin is used to integrate **UPI** Options in your **Android** app. You can use this plugin to initiate transaction to any UPI ID or to any Account number.  
[Check the Supported apps here.](#supported-apps)

For a complete example of how to use this plugin, look at the **Example** tab or in the [Github repository](https://github.com/mdazharuddin1011999/UPI-Plugin-Flutter/blob/master/example/lib/main.dart).

# IMPORTANT!
Some apps like Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm are currently unable to process the transaction and showing "Maximum limit exceeded" or "Risk threshold exceeded" errors. Reason for this is not clear yet.

## Help required
If you can help to extend this for iOS, feel free to check [this issue](https://github.com/mdazharuddin1011999/UPI-Plugin-Flutter/issues/20).  
If you can help to verify the compatibility of different UPI apps, feel free to check [this issue](https://github.com/mdazharuddin1011999/UPI-Plugin-Flutter/issues/23).

Thanks in advance :)

## How to start transaction?

### Step 1:
Import the Package:

```dart
import 'package:upi_india/upi_india.dart';
```

### Step 2:
Create **UpiIndia** object.

```dart
UpiIndia _upiIndia = UpiIndia();
```

### Step 3:
Get list of all apps in the device which can handle UPI Intent, as shown.

```dart
  List<UpiApp>? apps;

  @override
  void initState() {
    _upiIndia.getAllUpiApps(mandatoryTransactionId: false).then((value) {
      setState(() {
        apps = value;
      });
    }).catchError((e) {
      apps = [];
    });
    super.initState();
  }
```

**OR**

You can directly use the predefined apps, like:

```dart
UpiApp app = UpiApp.googlePay;
```

and assign it to the app parameter in **Step 4**

### Step 4:
Create a method which will start the transaction on being called, as shown.  
To initiate transaction to any UPI ID, directly pass the ID to `receiverId`  

```dart
  Future<UpiResponse> initiateTransaction(UpiApp app) async {
    return _upiIndia.startTransaction(
      app: app,
      receiverUpiId: "9078600498@ybl",
      receiverName: 'Md Azharuddin',
      transactionRefId: 'TestingUpiIndiaPlugin',
      transactionNote: 'Not actual. Just an example.',
      amount: 1.00,
    );
  }
```

### Step 5:
Call this method on any button click or through FutureBuilder and then you will get the Response!
***

## How to handle Response?

### Step 1:
After getting the snapshot from the Future, check if there is any error or not:

```dart
if (snapshot.hasError) {
  switch (snapshot.error.runtimeType) {
    case UpiIndiaAppNotInstalledException:
      print("Requested app not installed on device");
      break;
    case UpiIndiaUserCancelledException:
      print("You cancelled the transaction");
      break;
    case UpiIndiaNullResponseException:
      print("Requested app didn't return any response");
      break;
    case UpiIndiaInvalidParametersException:
      print("Requested app cannot handle the transaction");
      break;
    default:
      print("An Unknown error has occurred");
      break;
  }
}
```

### Step 2:
If **snapshot.hasError** is false, you can then get the response **UpiResponse** from **snapshot.data** and extract these parameters:
* Transaction ID
* Response Code
* Approval Reference Number
* Transaction Reference ID
* Status

### Step 3:
Check the Status property. It has following values:
* UpiPaymentStatus.SUCCESS
* UpiPaymentStatus.SUBMITTED
* UpiPaymentStatus.FAILURE

If Status is SUCCESS, Congratulations! You have successfully used this plugin.
